search my nextjs project for a place where there might be a notion of changing the colour scheme of my website

GitHub Copilot
I'll search your Next.js project for places where color scheme changes might be implemented. Let me start by searching for relevant code patterns.

Now let me search for the ThemeToggle component and any theme-related functionality more specifically:

Let me also check the config file to see the theme settings:

Read once-ui.config.js, lines 55 to 75

Let me also search for any color palette or theme customization files:

Based on my search through your Next.js project, I found several key places where color scheme changes are implemented:

Main Color Scheme Control Points:
1. ThemeToggle Component (ThemeToggle.tsx)
This is the primary component for changing between light and dark themes:

Located at ThemeToggle.tsx
Uses the useTheme hook from @once-ui-system/core
Toggles between 'light' and 'dark' themes
Currently displayed in the header navigation
2. Configuration File (once-ui.config.js)
This contains the main color scheme configuration:

Theme setting: theme: "system" (can be 'dark', 'light', or 'system')
Brand colors: brand: "cyan" (multiple color options available)
Accent colors: accent: "red" (multiple color options available)
Neutral colors: neutral: "gray" (sand, gray, slate, or custom)
3. Layout.tsx Theme Initialization (layout.tsx)
The root layout contains theme initialization logic:

Automatically detects system preference when theme is set to 'system'
Applies saved theme preferences from localStorage
Sets data attributes on the document root for theme application
4. Custom CSS Variables (custom.css)
Contains custom color scheme definitions:

Defines color tokens for brand, accent, and neutral color schemes
Currently has examples for custom color palettes (commented out)
Where You Can Change Color Schemes:
For theme switching (light/dark): The ThemeToggle component in the header
For color palette changes: Modify the style object in once-ui.config.js
For custom colors: Define new color schemes in custom.css
For background effects: Modify the effects object in the config file
The project uses the Once UI design system, which provides a systematic approach to color theming through data attributes and CSS custom properties.
