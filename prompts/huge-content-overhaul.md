my entire site needs a content overhaul from originally having content as a software/design company we are now a dj sound room focusing on sound engineering which includes production, mixing, djing, speaker system set ups including active speakers that require dsp and amplifiers

I'll help you transform your portfolio from a software/design company to a DJ sound room focusing on sound engineering. Let me first examine the current content structure to understand what needs to be changed.

Read content.js, lines 1 to 50

Read content.js, lines 51 to 150

Read content.js, lines 151 to 274

Now let me check the main pages to see what other content needs to be updated:

Read page.tsx, lines 1 to 50

Let me also check some of the project files to understand the current structure:

Read launch-of-our-v1-sound-system.mdx, lines 1 to 45

Now let me check the newsletter content and blog posts to see what else needs updating:

Read quick-start.mdx, lines 1 to 30

Now I have a good understanding of the current content structure. Let me start by updating the main content file to reflect the new DJ sound room focus:

content.js+2-2
content.js+3-3
content.js+10-6
content.js+21-8
content.js+2-2
content.js+2-2
content.js+2-2
Now let me update the work experience section to better reflect sound engineering and DJ services:

content.js+47-12
Now let me create some new sound engineering focused blog posts. First, let me check what blog posts currently exist:

Let me replace the quick-start blog post with sound engineering content:

quick-start.mdx+45-24
Now let me create a new blog post focused on mixing techniques:

Created mixing-techniques.mdx

Let me create another blog post about music production:

Created mpc-production.mdx

Now let me create a new sound engineering focused project to replace one of the existing software projects:

Created custom-speaker-system-design.mdx

Let me create another sound engineering project:

Created studio-mixing-mastering.mdx

Now let me update the existing project about the sound system to make it more comprehensive:

launch-of-our-v1-sound-system.mdx+232-32
Now let me create one more blog post about speaker systems and DSP:

Created active-speakers-dsp.mdx

Finally, let me update the home page featured project link to match our new sound system project:

The featured project link was already correct. Now let me check if there are any other content files that need updating. Let me look at the about page:

Read page.tsx, lines 1 to 50
